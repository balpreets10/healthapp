# Local Storage Analysis Report

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive analysis of local storage usage in the Gaming Dronzz Health Tracker application. The application stores various types of data locally to enhance user experience, maintain authentication state, and provide security features.

## Storage Types Used

### 1. **localStorage** (Primary Storage)
The application uses `localStorage` exclusively for client-side data persistence. No usage of `sessionStorage`, `IndexedDB`, or manual cookie management was found.

### 2. **Third-party Storage**
- **Supabase Client**: Uses built-in browser storage mechanisms for authentication session persistence
- **React/Browser Cache**: Internal component and asset caching

## Detailed Storage Inventory

### Authentication & Session Management

#### 1. **Extended Session Data** (`extended_session`)
- **Location**: `src/services/SupabaseService.ts:250-253`
- **Purpose**: Extends user session duration beyond default Supabase timeout
- **Data Structure**: 
  ```json
  {
    "expiry": "ISO datetime string",
    "userId": "user_id_string"
  }
  ```
- **Duration**: 30 days from creation
- **Why Stored**: Provides persistent authentication state for better user experience
- **Security**: Contains only expiry date and user ID (no sensitive tokens)

#### 2. **Supabase Session Persistence**
- **Location**: Supabase client configuration (`src/services/SupabaseService.ts:38`)
- **Purpose**: Built-in Supabase session management
- **Configuration**: `persistSession: true, autoRefreshToken: true`
- **Why Enabled**: Maintains user authentication across browser sessions and page refreshes
- **Data Stored**: Access tokens, refresh tokens, user metadata (managed by Supabase SDK)

### Security & Rate Limiting

#### 3. **Authentication Failure Attempts** (`health_auth_attempts`)
- **Location**: `src/managers/AuthManager.ts:162-163`
- **Purpose**: Track failed login attempts for security
- **Data**: Integer count of failed attempts
- **Why Stored**: Prevents brute force attacks by tracking failed login attempts
- **Duration**: Cleared on successful login or manual reset

#### 4. **Account Lockout Timer** (`health_auth_lockout`)
- **Location**: `src/managers/AuthManager.ts:171-172`
- **Purpose**: Enforce temporary account lockouts
- **Data**: Timestamp of lockout expiry
- **Why Stored**: Security measure to temporarily disable login after multiple failed attempts
- **Duration**: 15 minutes (as configured in AuthManager)

### User Profile Data

#### 5. **Extended Profile Data** (`profile_extra_{user_id}`)
- **Location**: `src/hooks/useCalorieTracker.ts:69-72`
- **Purpose**: Store additional profile information not in the database
- **Data Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "target_weight_kg": number,
    "target_duration": number,
    "target_duration_unit": "weeks" | "months",
    "orientation": string
  }
  ```
- **Why Stored**: Temporary storage for user preferences and calculated data
- **User-Specific**: Each user has their own storage key based on user ID

## Storage Operations Summary

### **Write Operations**
1. **Extended Session**: Written during successful authentication with "remember me" option
2. **Failed Attempts**: Incremented on each failed login attempt
3. **Lockout Timer**: Set when maximum failed attempts reached
4. **Profile Data**: Saved when user updates health goals and preferences

### **Read Operations**
1. **Session Check**: Read on app initialization and auth state changes
2. **Lockout Check**: Validated before allowing login attempts
3. **Profile Loading**: Retrieved when calculating calorie recommendations

### **Delete Operations**
1. **Session Cleanup**: Removed on explicit logout
2. **Security Reset**: Cleared on successful authentication
3. **Lockout Clear**: Removed when lockout period expires

## Security Considerations

### **Safe Data**
- ✅ No passwords or sensitive credentials stored
- ✅ Only user IDs and expiry timestamps
- ✅ Rate limiting data for security enhancement
- ✅ User-specific data isolation

### **Potential Concerns**
- ⚠️ User ID exposure in storage keys (low risk - not sensitive)
- ⚠️ Extended session duration (30 days) - consider user preference
- ℹ️ No encryption on stored data (not required for current data types)

## Browser Compatibility
- **localStorage**: Supported in all modern browsers
- **Error Handling**: Try/catch blocks protect against storage failures
- **Fallback**: App continues functioning if storage operations fail

## Data Retention
- **Authentication Data**: Until explicit logout or expiry
- **Security Data**: Until successful login or lockout expiry
- **Profile Data**: Until manually cleared or updated
- **No Automatic Cleanup**: Consider implementing storage cleanup for inactive users

## Recommendations
1. **Consider encryption** for sensitive profile data
2. **Add storage quota monitoring** to prevent storage limits
3. **Implement data expiry** for inactive user data
4. **Add user control** over extended session duration
5. **Consider compression** for larger profile data objects

## Storage Impact
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal (mostly small JSON objects)
- **Performance**: Fast access to cached user preferences
- **Network Reduction**: Reduces API calls for frequently accessed data
- **User Experience**: Seamless authentication and personalized experience
